Project One COP 3404
Author: Michael Frederick (n00725913)

Purpose: Create and implement a symbol table  that will be used by the assembler
during pass 1 and pass 2. It is constructed as an Hash table. The HashTable.java
file with an argument of an input file will start the routine to generate the
table with the output of where data was inserted and searched for contained
inside an output.txt file that will be written as the program executes.

Input file format:
The Input file should contain two types of data on each line. One of the Format,
[String] [Value], with which the Key value pair will be inserted into the Hash
table. The other format, [String], will be used as a key to search for the key
value pair. Each data item needs to be contained on it's own line.

To execute:
1. Compile the code using "javac *.java" or using the GNU command "make"
2. Use the command "java HashTable [input filename]"
    -After execution "output.txt" will be generated with the results of the
     execution.

Source Files:
HashTable.java
HashArray.java
DataItem.java
makefile
